## URL Shortner

TinyURL is a URL shortening service that allows users to convert long URLs into shorter, more manageable links that are easier to share and use. Here's a general overview of what TinyURL offers and how it functions:

### Purpose and Use
- **Simplifying Links:** TinyURL simplifies sharing long and complex URLs by shortening them into fewer characters. This is particularly useful in contexts like social media, emails, or text messages where space is limited or where long URLs may break.
- **Ease of Sharing:** Short URLs are more visually appealing and less intimidating for users to click on, facilitating easier sharing of links.

### Features
- **No Account Needed:** Users can create short URLs without needing to register or log in, which simplifies the process and makes it accessible to everyone.
- **Custom Aliases:** While the service automatically generates a short link, users also have the option to customize the latter part of the URL to make it recognizable or relevant to the content it links to (if the desired alias is available).
- **Redirection:** Like other URL shorteners, TinyURL redirects anyone who clicks on the short link to the original long URL.

### Technical Mechanism
- **URL Conversion:** When a user submits a URL, TinyURL generates a unique identifier that serves as the suffix for the shortened URL. This identifier is mapped to the original URL in TinyURL’s database.
- **Database Storage:** TinyURL stores the mapping of short codes to original URLs in a database, which it queries to redirect users when a short link is accessed.
- **Redirects:** Users who click on a TinyURL link are redirected via HTTP status codes (commonly 301 or 302), which instruct the browser to fetch the original URL.

### Reliability and Accessibility
- **Permanence:** The shortened URLs created by TinyURL are generally permanent unless specified otherwise, which means they should continue to redirect to the original URL indefinitely as long as TinyURL's services are operational.
- **Global Access:** The service is available globally and can be used by anyone with internet access to shorten URLs.

TinyURL, since its inception in 2002, has become one of the foundational tools on the internet for URL shortening, standing out for its simplicity and effectiveness. It is part of a broader category of web services that enhance usability and functionality of web browsing and sharing.

### Length of ShortURL

When a long URL is converted to a tiny URL, the length of the resulting shortened URL typically depends on the service used. Here are some common characteristics:

1. **Fixed-Length Short URLs:** Many URL shortening services, like Bit.ly or TinyURL, create short links that are a fixed length. This length varies between services but usually ranges from 6 to 10 characters after the domain name. For example, a Bit.ly link might look like `bit.ly/abc123`, where `abc123` is a 6-character unique identifier.

2. **Variable-Length Short URLs:** Some services may offer variable-length short URLs, especially if they allow custom aliases. These can be shorter or longer depending on the user's choice.

3. **Domain Length:** The overall length of a tiny URL also includes the length of the domain used by the shortening service (e.g., `bit.ly`, `tinyurl.com`).

In general, the goal of a tiny URL is to be significantly shorter than the original URL, especially when the original URL is very long, sometimes containing hundreds of characters. The shortening process involves using a unique identifier that maps to the original URL in the service's database. This makes it possible to redirect anyone who clicks on the tiny URL to the original URL.

### Steps

The process of converting a long URL into a tiny URL using a URL shortening service typically involves several steps:

1. **User Submits URL:**
   The user inputs the long URL into the URL shortening service’s website or API. This URL is the target that the user wants to make shorter for easier sharing or aesthetic purposes.

2. **URL Validation:**
   The service checks the URL to ensure it is valid. This means verifying that the URL follows the correct syntax and leads to an active website. Some services might also check for URLs that lead to malicious sites and refuse to shorten them.

3. **Generating a Unique Identifier:**
   Once the URL is validated, the service generates a unique identifier for the URL. This identifier is a short sequence of characters (letters and/or numbers) that will be part of the shortened URL. There are a few methods services might use to generate this identifier:
   - **Random Generation:** The service generates a random string of characters.
   - **Hashing:** The service uses a hash function on the original URL and then possibly truncates it to a suitable length.
   - **Incremental Counters:** Some services use a sequential counter that increases with each new URL added and then encodes this counter.

4. **Creating the Shortened URL:**
   The unique identifier is appended to the base URL of the shortening service. For example, if the service is `bit.ly` and the identifier is `abc123`, the resulting tiny URL would be `bit.ly/abc123`.

5. **Database Storage:**
   The service stores the mapping of the shortened URL to the original URL in a database. This record allows the service to redirect anyone who clicks on the shortened URL to the original URL. The database usually also records additional information such as the date of creation, the number of times the URL is accessed, and possibly the creator’s details if required.

6. **Redirection:**
   When someone clicks on the tiny URL, the shortening service looks up the identifier in its database, retrieves the corresponding long URL, and redirects the user to that URL. This happens very quickly, making the user experience nearly seamless.

7. **Tracking and Analysis (Optional):**
   Many URL shortening services offer tracking and analytical tools that allow the creator of the tiny URL to see how many times it has been clicked, from what locations, and using what devices. This information can be valuable for marketing and informational purposes.

Overall, URL shortening is a practical tool for simplifying long URLs and providing additional features like tracking and analytics, making it easier to manage and share URLs.

### Faster Retrieval

The redirection process from a tiny URL to the original long URL happens very quickly due to several technical optimizations and the straightforward nature of the operation. Here's a breakdown of why this redirection can be so fast:

1. **Simple Database Lookup:**
   - When a user clicks on a tiny URL, the unique identifier in the URL (e.g., `abc123` in `bit.ly/abc123`) is used to perform a quick lookup in the database.
   - URL shortening services typically use highly optimized databases designed for fast read operations. These databases are structured to quickly retrieve the original URL associated with a given identifier.

2. **Efficient Server Configuration:**
   - The servers that host these services are configured to handle HTTP requests very efficiently. They are often equipped with powerful hardware and are optimized to reduce latency in network communications.
   - Many services use load balancers to distribute incoming traffic evenly across multiple servers, ensuring no single server becomes a bottleneck.

3. **Use of Caching:**
   - Frequently accessed URLs can be stored in cache memory. Caching can dramatically reduce access time because the system retrieves the URL from fast-access memory rather than querying the database.
   - Caches are typically held in memory (RAM), which is much faster than retrieving data from disk-based storage.

4. **Geographic Distribution:**
   - To reduce latency, many services use content delivery networks (CDNs) or have servers located in multiple geographic locations. This setup ensures that the server handling the request is physically closer to the user, reducing the time taken for data to travel over the internet.

5. **Optimized Web Servers and Software:**
   - The web servers used (like Nginx or Apache) are highly efficient at handling HTTP requests and can quickly redirect users with minimal delay.
   - Software optimizations include streamlined code paths for redirection processes, ensuring that as few computational steps as possible are needed to translate a short URL back to its original form.

### Redirection

Redirection from a tiny URL to the original URL involves a simple yet efficient process. Here’s a detailed step-by-step explanation:

1. **Clicking the Tiny URL:**
   When a user clicks on a tiny URL (for example, `bit.ly/abc123`), their browser sends an HTTP request to the server that hosts the shortening service. This request includes the path component of the URL (`abc123` in this case).

2. **Server Receives Request:**
   The server hosting the tiny URL service receives the HTTP request. It parses the request to extract the unique identifier, which corresponds to the shortened part of the URL.

3. **Lookup the Identifier:**
   The server uses the unique identifier to perform a lookup in its database. This database stores mappings between the shortened identifiers and the original URLs. The lookup process is typically very fast, often optimized with indexes or caching for efficiency.

4. **Redirect Response:**
   Once the original URL is retrieved from the database, the server sends an HTTP response back to the user's browser. This response is a special type of HTTP status code:
   - **301 Moved Permanently:** Indicates that the URL of the requested resource has been changed permanently. This is often used for URL shortening to ensure that search engines and other services update their links.
   - **302 Found (Temporary Redirect):** Indicates that the URL of the requested resource has been temporarily changed. This might be used in situations where the redirection might change in the future.
   - **307 Temporary Redirect** or **308 Permanent Redirect:** These are newer codes similar to 302 and 301, respectively, but with stricter behavior concerning the method used in the subsequent request.

5. **Browser Follows Redirect:**
   The user's browser automatically follows the redirection by making a new HTTP request to the original URL provided in the redirection response. This happens without any further interaction from the user.

6. **Access the Original URL:**
   The browser retrieves the content from the original URL, and the webpage is displayed to the user. This final step completes the process from clicking the tiny URL to viewing the intended webpage.

This entire process, from clicking the tiny URL to accessing the original webpage, typically happens within a few milliseconds, thanks to the efficiency of modern web technologies and network communications. The user experiences it as almost instantaneous access to the desired website.

6. **HTTP Redirection Codes:**
   - The actual redirection from the tiny URL to the original URL is typically achieved using HTTP status codes like 301 (permanent redirect) or 302 (temporary redirect). These are standard responses in HTTP protocol, handled directly by the user's browser quickly and efficiently.

Because of these combined factors, when a user clicks on a tiny URL, the time between their click and the webpage starting to load is usually just a few milliseconds, leading to a seamless user experience.

## How data is stored and retrieved 

Storing millions of tiny URLs efficiently and ensuring quick access for redirection is a critical requirement for any URL shortening service. Here's how these services typically manage such a large volume of data:

### 1. **Database Systems**
URL shortening services use robust database systems to store the mappings between shortened URLs and their original URLs. These systems are chosen for their performance in high-read scenarios:

- **Relational Databases:** Traditional SQL databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL can be used, with optimizations for read performance, such as indexing on the shortened URL key to speed up lookup times.
- **NoSQL Databases:** Many services opt for NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Cassandra, or Redis because of their ability to handle large volumes of data with high input/output operations per second. These databases excel in scalability and performance for applications that don't require complex joins or transactions.

### 2. **Data Structure**
The typical data structure for storing a tiny URL involves:
- A unique identifier (the part of the URL that is shortened).
- The original URL.
- Optionally, metadata such as creation date, expiration date, the number of times the URL has been accessed, the creator’s information, etc.

### 3. **Highly Optimized Key-Value Stores**
For extremely high-performance needs, some services use key-value stores where the key is the shortened part of the URL, and the value is the original URL:
- **Key-Value Stores:** Technologies like Redis are particularly well-suited for this role due to their in-memory capabilities, providing extremely fast data retrieval.

### 4. **Scalability**
To handle growth and a high number of requests, URL shortening services design their architecture for scalability:
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Adding more servers to handle increased load. This is effective in services with high read and write operations.
- **Load Balancing:** Distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server bears too much load, which enhances the speed and availability of resources.

### 5. **Caching**
Caching frequently accessed URLs can significantly reduce database load and improve response times:
- **In-memory Caches:** Tools like Memcached or Redis cache popular URLs directly in RAM. This allows for sub-millisecond retrieval times, dramatically speeding up the redirection process.

### 6. **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**
Although not directly involved in storing the URLs, CDNs can be used to cache the landing pages or redirect pages closer to the user's location, reducing the time taken to load the initial content after redirection.

### 7. **Data Partitioning**
As the database grows, the data can be partitioned across different tables or even different databases to keep the system manageable and maintain performance:
- **Sharding:** Splitting the database into smaller, more manageable pieces, where each shard handles a portion of the traffic. This can be based on the hash of the shortened URL or other attributes.

Let's go through a detailed example of calculating the system requirements for a hypothetical URL shortening service similar to TinyURL. This example will cover the storage, database, and network considerations for handling 100 million URL shortening requests per month.

### 1. Storage Requirements
As previously calculated, let's recap the assumptions and find the storage requirement:
- **Original URL Length**: Average of 100 characters = 100 bytes (assuming UTF-8 encoding).
- **Short URL Identifier**: 6 bytes (assuming a simple alphanumeric code).
- **Metadata**: 100 bytes (timestamps, access counts, creator ID).
- **Total per Entry**: 100 + 6 + 100 = 206 bytes.

**Monthly Storage Calculation**:
- 100 million URLs × 206 bytes = 20.6 billion bytes = 20.6 GB.

**Annual Storage Requirement**:
- 20.6 GB/month × 12 = 247.2 GB per year.

### 2. Database Design
For handling high volumes of data with quick access requirements:
- **Database Type**: NoSQL (e.g., Cassandra or DynamoDB) for high write and read throughput and scalability.
- **Partitioning**: Sharding based on hashed values of the URL or a range of identifiers to distribute data evenly across multiple servers.
- **Replication**: Ensure data availability and durability by replicating data across different nodes or regions.

### 3. Network Bandwidth Considerations
Estimating the bandwidth needs assuming each shortening and redirection involves small data packets:
- **Average Request Size**: Let's estimate 500 bytes per request (including HTTP headers).
- **Average Response Size**: Approximately 300 bytes (smaller for redirects which just include headers and the URL).

**Monthly Bandwidth for Requests**:
- 100 million × 500 bytes = 50 billion bytes = 50 GB.

**Monthly Bandwidth for Responses**:
- 100 million × 300 bytes = 30 billion bytes = 30 GB.

**Total Monthly Bandwidth**:
- 50 GB + 30 GB = 80 GB.

### 4. Server Specifications
To handle this volume of traffic and data:
- **Load Balancers**: To distribute incoming requests evenly across servers.
- **Server Count**: Based on expected traffic, let's say each server can handle 1,000 requests per minute efficiently:
  - 100 million requests per month = \(\frac{100,000,000}{30 \times 24 \times 60}\) ≈ 2,315 requests per minute.
  - If one server handles 1,000 requests/minute, you would need at least 3 servers for handling peak loads and redundancy.

### 5. Redundancy and Failover
Ensure high availability:
- **Redundancy**: Deploy at least one redundant server in each critical component of the architecture.
- **Data Backup**: Regular backups and multi-region deployment if using a cloud service to guard against data loss and region-specific failures.

### 6. Security Measures
- **Encryption**: Encrypt data in transit using SSL/TLS and at rest to protect user data.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement to prevent abuse of the service and denial of service attacks.

This system design aims to provide a resilient, scalable, and efficient service capable of handling substantial loads with reliability. Adjustments may be needed based on specific operational feedback and real-world performance metrics.
