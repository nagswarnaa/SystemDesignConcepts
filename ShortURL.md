## URL Shortner

When a long URL is converted to a tiny URL, the length of the resulting shortened URL typically depends on the service used. Here are some common characteristics:

1. **Fixed-Length Short URLs:** Many URL shortening services, like Bit.ly or TinyURL, create short links that are a fixed length. This length varies between services but usually ranges from 6 to 10 characters after the domain name. For example, a Bit.ly link might look like `bit.ly/abc123`, where `abc123` is a 6-character unique identifier.

2. **Variable-Length Short URLs:** Some services may offer variable-length short URLs, especially if they allow custom aliases. These can be shorter or longer depending on the user's choice.

3. **Domain Length:** The overall length of a tiny URL also includes the length of the domain used by the shortening service (e.g., `bit.ly`, `tinyurl.com`).

In general, the goal of a tiny URL is to be significantly shorter than the original URL, especially when the original URL is very long, sometimes containing hundreds of characters. The shortening process involves using a unique identifier that maps to the original URL in the service's database. This makes it possible to redirect anyone who clicks on the tiny URL to the original URL.

The process of converting a long URL into a tiny URL using a URL shortening service typically involves several steps:

1. **User Submits URL:**
   The user inputs the long URL into the URL shortening service’s website or API. This URL is the target that the user wants to make shorter for easier sharing or aesthetic purposes.

2. **URL Validation:**
   The service checks the URL to ensure it is valid. This means verifying that the URL follows the correct syntax and leads to an active website. Some services might also check for URLs that lead to malicious sites and refuse to shorten them.

3. **Generating a Unique Identifier:**
   Once the URL is validated, the service generates a unique identifier for the URL. This identifier is a short sequence of characters (letters and/or numbers) that will be part of the shortened URL. There are a few methods services might use to generate this identifier:
   - **Random Generation:** The service generates a random string of characters.
   - **Hashing:** The service uses a hash function on the original URL and then possibly truncates it to a suitable length.
   - **Incremental Counters:** Some services use a sequential counter that increases with each new URL added and then encodes this counter.

4. **Creating the Shortened URL:**
   The unique identifier is appended to the base URL of the shortening service. For example, if the service is `bit.ly` and the identifier is `abc123`, the resulting tiny URL would be `bit.ly/abc123`.

5. **Database Storage:**
   The service stores the mapping of the shortened URL to the original URL in a database. This record allows the service to redirect anyone who clicks on the shortened URL to the original URL. The database usually also records additional information such as the date of creation, the number of times the URL is accessed, and possibly the creator’s details if required.

6. **Redirection:**
   When someone clicks on the tiny URL, the shortening service looks up the identifier in its database, retrieves the corresponding long URL, and redirects the user to that URL. This happens very quickly, making the user experience nearly seamless.

7. **Tracking and Analysis (Optional):**
   Many URL shortening services offer tracking and analytical tools that allow the creator of the tiny URL to see how many times it has been clicked, from what locations, and using what devices. This information can be valuable for marketing and informational purposes.

Overall, URL shortening is a practical tool for simplifying long URLs and providing additional features like tracking and analytics, making it easier to manage and share URLs.
