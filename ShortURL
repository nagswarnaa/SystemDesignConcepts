When a long URL is converted to a tiny URL, the length of the resulting shortened URL typically depends on the service used. Here are some common characteristics:

1. **Fixed-Length Short URLs:** Many URL shortening services, like Bit.ly or TinyURL, create short links that are a fixed length. This length varies between services but usually ranges from 6 to 10 characters after the domain name. For example, a Bit.ly link might look like `bit.ly/abc123`, where `abc123` is a 6-character unique identifier.

2. **Variable-Length Short URLs:** Some services may offer variable-length short URLs, especially if they allow custom aliases. These can be shorter or longer depending on the user's choice.

3. **Domain Length:** The overall length of a tiny URL also includes the length of the domain used by the shortening service (e.g., `bit.ly`, `tinyurl.com`).

In general, the goal of a tiny URL is to be significantly shorter than the original URL, especially when the original URL is very long, sometimes containing hundreds of characters. The shortening process involves using a unique identifier that maps to the original URL in the service's database. This makes it possible to redirect anyone who clicks on the tiny URL to the original URL.
